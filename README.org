#+title: pcbro: Wire-Cell PCB Anode Readout Package

This WCT user package provides some Wire-Cell Toolkit components and
support code for the PCB anode readout (pcbro) R&D and specifically
its use in the 50L test detector.

* Roadmap

The development roadmap for this package is:

- [X] generate initial package skeleton with [[https://github.com/brettviren/moo][moo]].
- [X] raw data decoder for the ~.bin~ files produced by the 50L DAQ.
- [X] a WCT "source" component that will provide this data as WCT tensors
- [ ] a WCT configuration to convert ~.bin~ to ~.npz~ files
- [ ] produce event displays to confirm decoder works

After this is done, most work is outside the repo:

- [ ] produce fake WCT "wires file" mostly to serve as channel map (save to ~wire-cell-data~)
- [ ] produce Garfield simulation output (Yichen)
- [ ] convert Garfield output to WCT ~.json.bz2~ file (save to ~wire-cell-data~)
- [ ] develop WCT configuration to run sigproc on ~.bin~ and save results to zero-padded ~.npz~

* Install

This package is not yet ready for use but it may be built against a
WCT installation doing something like:

#+begin_example
  $ ./wcb configure --prefix=/path/to/install \
        --with-wct=$HOME/opt/wct \
        [...maybe other --with-* flags...]
  $ ./wcb --notests install
  $ ./wcb --alltests
#+end_example
